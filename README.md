# Word Wrecker

![Icon](/docs/icon.png)

Word Wrecker started development as simply *"Mobile Word Search"* in 2017. The premise was always the same, *"Candy Crush" x "Scrabble"*.
In 2020, I finally had the time to learn the skills I would need to properly publish my game, and so Word Wrecker launched to the Google Play Store as an Android app. Download it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.kk47.mws)!

One of the features I wanted in the app was the ability to add words after launch without having to push an update to the core APK. To achieve this, the app is now designed to access this repository on load and download any new words.

### Adding Words or Pull Requests
To avoid having words be added which are either insensative, slang, or otherwise not viable words to add, please send missing words to me directly via any means you choose. I will check against dictionaries to validate it is a word and suibtable for the game, and then add it when I am able.
Pull Requests will not be accepted for this repository.
